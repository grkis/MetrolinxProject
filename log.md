- Meeting with Shawn about problem statement (11:30 am to 11:40am). Feedback includes:
  - Our proposal was taking on too much (Shawn mentioned how it could be a collaborative project in of itself). We need to be more specific and take the focus away from data processing/cleaning. 
  - Change the proposal to make a web-based application that works as a communication tool between Metrolinx and the public.
  - The core problem is that there is a disconnect between the public’s needs in terms of public transportation and the feasibility of it (due to many factors, but one being climate change).  
- Problem Statement not yet approved. Work for next week! 
  - To-do for next week: 
    - Problem statement revision
    - Find a web layer that we can work with. Otherwise, we’ll need to publish our own using ArcGIS Pro, but don’t sink too much time into this (data processing is not the main goal!)
- Lecture (1h) about project introduction and working in a collaborative environment. 
- Total time: ~4.5h

## Week 10: Problem Statement Revision + Data Collection
- March 13-17th 
- Individual work on finding a web layer to support the application (0.5h)
- Individual work on creating and publishing web layer using ArcGIS Pro (1.5h) 
  - Output: <https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=d01b948e53504060b17b7230f58d4a84> 
- Revising problem statement with group (Meeting: Friday, March 17th from 10am to 11:20am) 
- Meeting with Shawn about problem statement.
  - Initial feedback: Too long, sounds too “academic.” 
  - Problem statement approved!
- Total time: ~3.5h 

## Week 11: Utilizing the webmap
- Meeting with group on how to utilize the webmap 
  - Plan: 
    - ArcGIS Pro to spatially join the data layers (done – 30min)
    - ArcGIS Online Map Viewer to configure popup
      - Use arcade 
      - Popup script written (45min)
      - Field configuration 
    - ArcGIS Web App Builder
      - Widgets to use: 
        - Bookmark (to highlight zones of low climate resiliency) 
        - Search function 
        - About page (popup) 
        - Query
        - Legend, basemap toggles, zoom functions
      - Documentation reading took ~1h 
      - We decided a web app is the most appropriate application to use. 
        - We can host this on ArcGIS Hub 
        - Literature review of ArcGIS Hub (done during collaboration project meeting with the group, since we are using ArcGIS Hub for the collab project as well)
